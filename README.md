## Problem Statement

Problem Statement
The Olympic Games are a massive global event, featuring thousands of athletes from numerous countries competing across a variety of sports. Tracking and analyzing data from such an event is a complex challenge. For event organizers, media, and analysts, understanding the following is critical:

- Which countries are performing the best?
- How is the medal tally distributed across countries and sports?
- Which athletes are excelling in their respective events?
- What are the trends in performance based on factors like age, gender, and country?
This project aims to address these challenges by developing a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends from the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

## Key Features
- Country-wise Medal Analysis: Breakdown of the medal tally by country, sport, and event.
- Athlete Performance: Detailed insights into top-performing athletes and their achievements.

### Steps followed 

This project involves several steps, from downloading the data to preparing it for visualization. Here’s a breakdown of the entire process:

Step 1: Setting Up Kaggle API and Python Environment
First, we need to set up the Kaggle API to access and download datasets.
- Sign up on Kaggle
- Create an API Token: In your Kaggle account settings, go to the “API” section and click “Create New API Token.” This will download a kaggle.json file containing your credentials.
- Save the API Token: Place the kaggle.json file in a secure directory on your machine, where it will be used to authenticate the Kaggle API.
